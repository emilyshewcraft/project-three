## Interactive Visualization Project
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Title:
    K-12 School Shooting Incidents: 1970-2022
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Team Members:
* Emily Shewcraft
* Daniel Meyerowitz
* Louis Ferrante
* Callie Carlton
* Dianna Rivera

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Description/Outline
### Data Collection and Analyses
1. Imported data found in Kaggle
2. Cleaned and prepared data (ETL) in Jupyter Notebook
3. Compared variables to address research questions
4. Stored data in Mongo database
5. Utilized Python Flask API to tie data to local host
6. Incorporated HTML/CSS code to build base site structure
7. Created interactive map using JavaScript

### Presentation and Summarization 
4. Created and presented a formal visual presentation, including interactive visual elements
5. Drafted written analysis of the data
6. Summarized conclusions

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Questions
1. To what degree over time have school shooting incidents increased since 1970?
2. How does the level of education (high, middle, elementary) affect the incident rate?
3. Does the population of the area affect incident rates?
4. What is the most common type of weapon utilized in these incidents?
5. Are the majority of these incidents targeted or randon shootings?
6. Does the age of the shooter impact the incident rate? What about age of the victims?
7. What is the most common outcome for the shooter? What about for the victims?

### Conclusion

Possible drawbacks-the COVID-19 pandemic may show skewed data due to lower in-person attendance rates
